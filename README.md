I'm creating R code to download weather data from based on the US county FIPS code

Originial script that I followed is from this website: https://www.kaggle.com/johnjdavisiv/us-counties-weather-health-hospitals-covid19-data

Here I've located NOAA-GSOD station based on the power plants facility location so that we get meteorological dataset from the NOAA stations which are close to the electric facilities.


This code and dataset are also available on GMU Hopper cluster /projects/HAQ_LAB/mrasel/R/NOAA-GSOD-weather-data
